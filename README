Buller - Follow Profitable Portfolios

I will now describe the site features in words:

Every page has the navigation bar in it.

Navigation bar:
	The navigation bar functions differently when logged-in Vs. when logged-out.
	Logged-in:
		You - access your private acount directly.
		Users - Go to users list.
		Stocks - Go to stocks list.
		Logout - Logout and redirected to the home page.
	Logged-out:
		Signin - sign in to the site.
		Login - login, go to users page.

Single User Page:
	You are able to go over other users details in this page.
	If you enter your Single User Page then you can also Sell stocks (or "close" positions)

Users page:
	In this page you can see all the users sorted by the user portfolio profit (where most profitable is on top).
	From this page you can access the single user page of each user on that list.

Stocks page:
	In this page you can see the stocks that are available to buy. The list is currently maintained by hand, and includs only 5 stocks (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Vista Gold and Yahoo!). This is due to the high latency from Yahoo!(I use the data from Yahoo!)

Single stock page:
	Here you can see more details about a certain stock, you can also Buy it here.


Under the hood:
	I use MD5 for password cashing.
	CodeIgniter is used.
